# mp3toflac

A simple script I wrote to convert files from mp3 to flac. I did this to resolve playback issues with some mp3 files in my car audio deck. 
There is very little reason to convert from mp3 to flac, since mp3 is lossy and flac is lossless it would be better to re-rip from your original media if possible.
In my case, original re-rip was not possible without the digging around and onboxing of items from basement storage, so a little quality loss was a suitable stop-gap to that hassle.


Feel free to re-use, distribute etc...  Please give credit if code is used part or in whole.

Usage:
./mp3toflac.py <target_dir>


NOTE: flac files consume far more space than mp3 files. Please consider this when converting and don't exhaust the disk space of your drive in the process. This is one more reason why converting from mp3 to flac is typically not a great use case. If you are going to give up the extra space to house a flac file it would be better to re-rip so the quality of the song is higher to justify the increased cost in space.
