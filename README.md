# mp3toflac

A simple script I wrote to convert fils from mp3 to flac. I did this to resolve playback issues with some mp3 files in my car audio deck. 
There is very little reason to convert from mp3 to flac, since mp3 is lossy and flac is lossless it would be better to re-rip from your original media if possible.
In my case, original re-rip was not possible with the digging around and onboxing of items from basement storage, so a little quality loss was a suitable stop-gap to that hassle.


Feel free to re-use, distribute etc...  Please give credit if code is used part or in whole.

Usage:
./mp3toflac.py <target_dir>
